# What are these?

This is settings for using **Sublime Text 2**.

Originally customised for myself ([skywinder][]).

As the base for customisation I took [d2s's settigs](https://github.com/d2s/Sublime-Text-2-User-Settings).

Your mileage may vary.

# WARNING!

I keep modifying these more or less daily so things might get broken.
Don't blame me if that happens.
It's probably better to make copy of these to another location and just copy the parts you find most useful.
